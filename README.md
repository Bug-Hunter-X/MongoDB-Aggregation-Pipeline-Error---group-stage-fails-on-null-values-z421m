# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: $group stage fails on null values

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines where the `$group` stage throws an error when encountering `null` values for the grouping field.  The issue arises when the field used in the `$group` stage is not consistently present in all documents that pass the `$match` stage.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic aggregation pipeline, and `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solution.  The solution includes error handling and the use of the `$ifNull` operator to handle potential null values gracefully.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB database.
3. Create a sample collection with documents containing the field used in the `$group` stage sometimes null.
4. Run `bug.js`. This should throw an error.
5. Run `bugSolution.js`.  This corrected pipeline will produce the expected results.

## Solutions

This issue is resolved using the `$ifNull` operator within the `$group` stage. This operator checks for `null` values and replaces them with a default value (in this case, an empty string). This prevents the `$group` stage from throwing an error and allows the aggregation to continue successfully.
